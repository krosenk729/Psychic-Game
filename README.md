## Rules:
* You have 9 guesses (one letter at a time)
* After 9 wrong guesses, you lose and get 9 more guesses for a new letter
* After a correct guess, you win and get 9 more guesses for a new letter

## Homweork Instructions Guess what letter I'm thinking of

* Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)
* Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)
* Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)
* Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)
* When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).
* When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).
